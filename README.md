How to Play
-----------
When the menu shows up:

1 — Fight
  - Press Enter to attack each turn until the enemy is defeated (or you die).

  - Spend coins on potions and weapons.

3 — Inventory
  - Use a Health Potion to heal (if you have any).

4 — Exit

If something breaks, that’s part of the journey.
