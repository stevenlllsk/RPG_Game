I’ve been learning C++ and now I’m building a small command-line RPG.
This is my first real project: Runecrawl.

Current Goals

Add upgrades in the shop: swords, shields, and armor with basic stats.

Make a simple inventory so enemies can drop potions, armor, and weapons.

Add more enemy types (might need some code changes).

More updates coming as I keep learning and improving the game!
