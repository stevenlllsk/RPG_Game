So i have been learning C++ for a bit, and I've seen that I've got enough to actually start developing a little command line RPG Game so here it is.








PLANS:
The next update that i am planning is specific upgrades and possibly a crude inventory system. To dive deeper is, you in the shop, will be able to buy swords or a shield and armor.
Which will have stats too(which i will maybe have to improve).
