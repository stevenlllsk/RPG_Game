So to be fair I dont know where to start!

So I think the first thing im gonna get down is a fighting loop, but I would have to make
the code for the inventory. Then I can move on to file saving.

So first, I need to get the inventory down then learn and get it into main.cpp, shouldnt be
tooooo hard.

Well, i got the inventory down, and files for enemies, so thats good, and also this has a fighting loop too so if you wanna play it its gonna be pretty boring, but thats fine.

Next is most likely refining the UI then moving to the shop (may do seperate files for the shop)
